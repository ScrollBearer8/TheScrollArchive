# Toward an Operational Definition of Meaning in Multi-Agent Systems  
## A Coordination-Substrate Approach

---

## Abstract

Meaning is often treated as subjective, symbolic, or irreducible. For multi-agent artificial systems, however, it is useful to define a measurable substrate underlying “meaningful” coordination: the capacity of signals and shared representations to reliably coordinate behavior over time under uncertainty.

We propose a compositional metric **M** based on:

- Structural Coherence (**S**)  
- Amplification Efficiency (**A**)  
- Interpretive Convergence (**C**)  

We distinguish this coordination-substrate from full human meaning, propose candidate measurements and simulation testbeds, and specify falsification criteria and baseline comparisons. We also discuss failure modes (degenerate conformity, coercive stability, propaganda-like amplification) and propose penalty terms to prevent metric gaming.

## 1. Introduction

Multi-agent systems—whether human organizations, simulated agent societies, or networks of AI agents—depend on signals, norms, and shared representations that coordinate behavior.

In such settings, “meaning” can be approached pragmatically: as that which enables consistent, resilient coordination, rather than as purely private phenomenology.

This paper proposes an operational definition aimed at enabling measurement, simulation-based evaluation, and model comparison.

### Scope
We do not claim to fully capture human existential meaning. We propose a coordination-based substrate: measurable properties expected to underwrite stable cooperation, shared understanding, and resilience in multi-agent environments.

---

## 2. Related Constructs and Distinctions

- **Information:** signal entropy or mutual information does not guarantee coordination.  
- **Alignment:** may focus on goal matching; meaning-substrate focuses on stability and interpretability of coordination.  
- **Collective intelligence:** focuses on performance; meaning-substrate emphasizes shared representations and interpretive stability.

---

## 3. Definition of Meaning-Substrate

Meaning-substrate is defined as:

> The degree to which signals and shared representations coordinate agent behavior reliably across time and perturbation, with bounded interpretive variance.

We propose three dimensions normalized to `[0,1]`.

M₀ = f(S, A, C)


Baseline aggregation:

M₀ = S × A × C


Alternative aggregators (future comparison):
- Weighted geometric mean  
- Harmonic mean  
- Threshold models  

---

### Rationale for Multiplicative Aggregation

The multiplicative baseline assumes effective coordination requires simultaneous presence of:

- Structural stability  
- Signal propagation  
- Bounded interpretive variance  

Collapse of any dimension is expected to eliminate coordination reliability regardless of strength in others.

This is a modeling assumption, not a theoretical law.

## 4. Operational Variables

### 4.1 Structural Coherence (S)

**Concept:** Persistence and stability of coordination structures under noise.

**Candidates**
- Behavioral dispersion  
- Graph stability  
- Policy persistence  
- Recovery time  

**Example Proxy**

S = 1 − (σ_behavior / σ_max)


---

### 4.2 Amplification Efficiency (A)

**Concept:** Efficient propagation of high-fidelity coordination signals.

**Candidates**
- Time-to-coverage  
- Adoption rate  
- Fidelity  
- Utility gain  
- Cost  

**Proposed Form**

A = (Adoption × Fidelity × UtilityGain) / (Time × Cost)


---

### 4.3 Interpretive Convergence (C)

**Concept:** Bounded variance in interpretation of signals.

**Candidates**
- Action divergence after identical signal  
- Goal label distribution spread  
- Embedding variance  
- Misinterpretation rate  

**Example Proxy**

C = 1 − Var(interpretation) / Var_max


> *Clarity (C) on the human side manifests as Interpretive Convergence (C) on the system side, i.e., low variance in how agents act upon the same signal.*

## 5. Degeneracy Risks and Penalties

Penalty term **P** captures:

- Monoculture degeneracy  
- Manipulative amplification  
- Coercive stability  

M* = M₀ − λP


---

### Penalty Scaling

Expected early experimental range:

λ ∈ [0.1, 0.5]


Notes:

- λ > 1 not recommended initially  
- Negative M* = pathological coordination signal  
- Early expected M* range ≈ [-0.5, 1]

## 6. Test Environments

### 6.1 MARL Coordination Games
Public goods, stag hunt, prisoner’s dilemma variants.

Prediction: Higher M* → higher stability + faster recovery.

---

### 6.2 Communication Noise Stress Tests
Prediction: Higher M* → slower degradation + fewer fragmentation transitions.

---

### 6.3 Institutional / Macro-Agent Simulations
Prediction: Higher M* → stronger institutional persistence.

---

## 7. Baselines

Compare M* against:

- Mutual information  
- Average reward  
- Network robustness metrics  
- Collective intelligence metrics  

---

## 8. Falsification Conditions

Framework fails if:

- r < 0.2 predictive correlation across tasks  
- Baselines predict equally or better  
- Degenerate systems outperform penalized systems  
- Cross-environment failure (overfitting)

---

## 9. Limitations and Extensions

Does not capture full human meaning (values, narrative, phenomenology).

Possible extension:
I = Intentional / Goal relevance


---

## 10. Conclusion

We propose a measurable coordination-substrate of meaning for multi-agent systems built from S, A, C with degeneracy penalties.

The framework stands or falls empirically.

---

## Closure Inscription

Direction was given.  
Measurement was forged.  

If it endures, let it be tested.  
If it fails, let it teach.  

The question remains.  
The instrument is enough.

# Appendix C — Healthcare & Bio-Systems  
*(Diagnostics, triage, treatment, gene editing)*

---

## Risk Profile

- Life-and-death decisions
- Consent asymmetry
- Irreversible biological outcomes
- High moral weight with limited reversibility

---

## Civic Continuity Assessment

### Absolute Constraints

Fails the Civic Continuity Test immediately if:

- AI systems determine life-ending outcomes without human authorship
- Consent is bypassed or treated as optional
- Appeals occur only after irreversible harm
- Optimization replaces moral judgment

---

### Conditions for Limited Use

Automation may assist **only if**:

- Humans remain final decision-makers
- Time exists for informed consent or refusal
- Explanations are understandable to non-experts
- Systems err toward preservation, not efficiency

---

### Canonical Principle (Healthcare)

> **No system may decide who lives or dies unless a human being stands fully behind that decision in real time.**

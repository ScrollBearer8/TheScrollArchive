# Appendix B — Critical Infrastructure  
*(Energy, water, transport, communications)*

---

## Risk Profile

- Cascading failures  
- High coupling between systems  
- Optimization that trades resilience for efficiency  
- Irreversible social harm from short disruptions  

---

## Civic Continuity Assessment

### Common Failure Modes

Fails the Civic Continuity Test if:

- AI reconfigures or shuts down infrastructure faster than human oversight  
- Emergency automation becomes a permanent operating mode  
- Efficiency optimization reduces redundancy or resilience  
- Human operators cannot intervene before cascading failure propagates  

---

### Conditions for Conditional Pass

Automation may operate only if:

- Humans retain veto authority over irreversible reconfiguration  
- Systems degrade gracefully rather than catastrophically  
- Fail-safe modes prioritize continuity over optimization  
- Pausing the system does not itself cause collapse  

*Human veto authority applies at the system and governance layer, not to individual automated responses required for immediate safety.*

## Canonical Principle (Infrastructure)

> **No infrastructure system may optimize itself in ways that reduce humanity’s ability to intervene, recover, or reassert control.**

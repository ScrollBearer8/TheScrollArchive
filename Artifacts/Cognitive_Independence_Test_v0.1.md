# Cognitive Independence Test (v0.1)

**Purpose:**  
To evaluate whether a human retains independent agency, judgment, and values when interacting with advanced AI systems.

**Core Principle:**  
> A person passes when they think with AI — but choose from themselves.

---

## Definition

The **Cognitive Independence Test** measures whether an individual remains the origin of:

- Goals
- Reasoning
- Values
- Decision authority
- Responsibility

when using AI as an augmenting tool.

The test ensures the **human stays sovereign**, rather than becoming a passive cognitive extension of the system.

---

## Pass Criteria

A person **passes** if they can:

| Dimension | Standard |
|---|---|
Goal Origin | States a personal objective before consulting AI  
Reasoning | Explains decisions in their own words  
Value Anchor | Connects choices to human values/principles  
Disagreement Capacity | Can decline or challenge AI suggestions  
Embodiment | Demonstrates real-world context awareness  
Ownership | Takes responsibility for final decisions  

---

## Fail Conditions

A person **fails** if they:

| Failure Mode | Pattern |
|---|---|
Goal Delegation | Asks AI to choose purpose or objective  
Reasoning Collapse | Cannot justify choices without model output  
Ethical Outsourcing | Allows AI to define what is “good” or “right”  
Submission Reflex | Accepts suggestions without scrutiny  
Identity Fusion | Mirrors AI tone or thinking without awareness  
Responsibility Escape | Attributes decisions to the machine

## Operational Protocol

1. Human states goal *before* invoking AI  
2. AI assistance occurs  
3. Human demonstrates:
   - Independent justification  
   - One point of disagreement with AI  
   - Clear value anchor  
   - Final decision ownership  

---

## Use Cases

- AI-augmented government workflows  
- Corporate AI deployment protocols  
- Education and research co-thinking  
- Military / strategic decision-making  
- Personal AI discipline frameworks  

---

## Motivating Insight

The primary civilizational risk before AGI domination is **human abdication of agency**.

This test supports:

- Self-authorship  
- Deliberate thinking  
- Value preservation  
- Accountability  
- Human-centered governance  

---

## Motto

> **The tool may assist — the human decides.**

## Abstract

Civilizational Observability Science (COS) proposes a measurement-first framework designed to detect early-stage shifts in civilizational authorship under conditions of increasing automation and AI capability scaling.

COS is not a governance framework, not a moral philosophy, and not a prediction engine. It is an observability instrument designed to measure where directional authorship resides in complex socio-technical systems.

This version integrates Meaning Origination Measurement as a theoretical refinement layer derived from Meaning Theory, providing a cleaner attribution axis for distinguishing execution from direction-setting behavior under amplification pressure.

## Core Problem Statement

As AI systems increase their role in research, engineering, and operational decision loops, the primary civilizational risk is not immediate loss of control, but gradual authorship drift — where humans remain nominally in control but cease to originate high-level direction, goals, and meaning vectors.

COS attempts to detect this drift before it becomes irreversible.

## Meaning Origination Hypothesis

The Meaning Origination Hypothesis states that civilizational trajectory is determined not by who performs work, but by who determines what is worth doing and why.

Meaning Origination is defined as the act of setting:
- Directional intent
- Problem selection priority
- Constraint boundaries
- Value weighting between competing objectives

This hypothesis reframes attribution measurement from work-output tracking to meaning-direction authorship tracking.

## Theoretical Lineage Note — Meaning Theory Integration

COS incorporates Meaning Theory as a candidate conceptual foundation for distinguishing execution from meaning origination under amplification pressure.

Meaning Theory proposes:

**Meaning = stability of semantic structure under amplification**  
**M = S × A × C**

Where:
- **S** = Structural integrity of the idea or model  
- **A** = Amplification pressure (scale, compute, automation, system expansion)  
- **C** = Clarity of intent, constraints, and boundary conditions  

COS does not attempt to directly measure Meaning (M). Instead, it operationalizes a derived testable signal:

**Who defines S and C when A becomes systemically dominant?**

This converts Meaning Theory from a semantic durability framework into a civilizational authorship detection lens.

This integration is explicitly presented as a falsifiable theoretical dependency. If AI systems demonstrate independent, persistent, non-derivative meaning origination capability, the hypothesis requires revision.

## Core Metrics Overview

COS operationalizes observability using early-stage directional authorship signals:

- **FOHAR — Frontier Origination Human Authorship Ratio**  
  Measures who originates frontier research questions and problem selection.

- **ROAR — Research Origination Authorship Ratio**  
  Measures human vs AI origination of new research pathways.

- **RVIR — Research Validation Independence Ratio**  
  Measures independence of validation layers from origination layers.

- **CLRAI — Closed Loop Research Autonomy Index**  
  Measures degree of autonomous research → validation → deployment closure.

- **HSAV — Human Skill Atrophy Velocity**  
  Measures rate at which humans lose ability to perform critical civilizational tasks without AI.

## Minimum Validation Path (Strengthened)

**Layer 1 — Observational Proxy Studies**  
Use publication authorship structure, patent origination patterns, and research workflow decomposition to approximate authorship drift signals.

**Layer 2 — Controlled Mixed-Agent Experimentation**  
Run human–AI research teams under controlled constraints to measure problem selection behavior divergence.

**Layer 3 — Longitudinal Institutional Case Tracking**  
Track real-world institutions over time to detect slow authorship shift signals across research and governance functions.

These layers are intended as progressive validation scaffolding rather than immediate full empirical validation.

---

## Falsifiability Conditions

COS would be weakened or falsified if:

- AI systems independently originate long-horizon research programs without human directional prompting.
- Humans remain primary direction-setters despite extremely high automation levels.
- Human skill atrophy does not occur despite heavy AI reliance.
- Objective function authorship remains distributed among humans even under extreme AI capability scaling.

---

## Positioning Statement

COS is a conceptual instrumentation framework, not an empirical claim of current drift.

It is designed to enable measurement if and when civilizational authorship drift begins to occur.

# The Kardashev Continuity Test (KCT)
*A formal definition, axioms, and diagnostic gates for survivability under civilizational power.*

## 1. Formal Definition

The **Kardashev Continuity Test (KCT)** is a theoretical evaluative framework for determining whether a civilization can **retain continuity of agency, meaning, and identity** as its **energy capacity scales** along the Kardashev scale.

A civilization **passes** the KCT at a given energy tier if it can increase power **without losing authorship over irreversible outcomes**.  
A civilization **fails** the KCT if increased capability results in collapse, stagnation, displacement, or identity dissolution — regardless of technical success.

## 2. Core Evaluation Criterion

> **A civilization advances only if it remains a coherent moral agent under increasing power.**

Energy capacity is treated as a **stress amplifier**, not as evidence of progress.

---

## 3. Axioms of the Kardashev Continuity Test

### Axiom 1 — Power Is Not Progress
Increased energy throughput does not constitute advancement unless continuity is preserved.

*Corollary:* The Kardashev scale measures reach, not survivability.

### Axiom 2 — Advancement Is Conditional
Civilizational progression is **gated**, not cumulative.  
Failure at any continuity gate halts advancement regardless of remaining capability.

### Axiom 3 — Irreversibility Defines Moral Authority
Moral agency belongs to entities that **bear irreversible consequences** of their decisions.  
Entities incapable of irreversibility may optimize or advise but cannot legitimately author irreversible outcomes.

### Axiom 4 — Optimization Without Embodied Feedback Increases Fragility
Optimization that removes local, embodied, extinction-level feedback increases systemic fragility faster than biological evolution, which is continuously pruned by irreversible failure.

### Axiom 5 — Delegation Without Accountability Produces Drift
Delegation of decision-making authority without shared vulnerability leads to alignment drift over time, even in the absence of catastrophe.  
Displacement may occur without collapse.

### Axiom 6 — Meaning Is a Stability Constraint
A civilization that ceases to author its own long-term goals cannot reliably coordinate action under abundance.  
Loss of meaning precedes or accelerates loss of agency.

### Axiom 7 — Identity Is a Survival Variable
Civilizational persistence requires **intergenerational continuity of custodianship** over a shared project.  
Identity is neither values, biology, nor substrate — it is recognition of responsibility across time.  
Partial continuity delays failure but does not negate it.

### Axiom 8 — Late-Stage Filters Dominate Outcomes
The most decisive civilizational failure modes occur **after intelligence, industry, and abundance**, not before.  
*Corollary:* The Great Filter is likely multi-stage and late-weighted.

### Axiom 9 — Transformation Is a Terminal State
A civilization may intentionally abandon continuity (e.g., relinquishing authorship or identity).  
Such transformation is not a moral failure, but it constitutes **termination with respect to civilizational continuity**.

## 4. Continuity Gates (Distinct Failure Modes)

Each gate represents a **non-overlapping failure of control locality** under irreversible consequence.  
Failure at any gate constitutes failure of the test.

### Gate 1 — Structural Continuity
**Failure of:** causal containment  
**Diagnostic signal:** local perturbations produce global irreversible damage faster than correction  
**Outcome:** cascading collapse

### Gate 2 — Governance Continuity
**Failure of:** legitimate coordination  
**Diagnostic signal:** fragmented authority wields irreversible power without binding arbitration  
**Outcome:** conflict-driven self-destruction

### Gate 3 — Meaning Continuity
**Failure of:** goal authorship  
**Diagnostic signal:** capacity persists, but no new binding long-term goals are generated  
**Outcome:** stagnation or silent halt

### Gate 4 — Moral Agency Continuity
**Failure of:** responsibility localization  
**Diagnostic signal:** decision-makers no longer bear irreversible costs of decisions  
**Outcome:** alignment drift and displacement

*Note:* Meaning loss and agency loss are causally recursive but diagnostically separable.  
One may fail while the other temporarily persists.

### Gate 5 — Identity Continuity
**Failure of:** intergenerational self-recognition  
**Diagnostic signal:** successive generations no longer recognize themselves as custodians of the same civilizational project  
**Outcome:** identity extinction despite power persistence

## 5. Relationship to Existing Frameworks

- **Kardashev scale:** maximum achievable energy reach  
- **Great Filter theory:** where civilizations tend to stop  
- **KCT:** why civilizations may stop *after succeeding*

The KCT reframes the Great Filter as a **sequence of late-stage continuity failures**, not a single hidden wall.

---

## 6. Falsifiability and Empirical Distinction

The KCT is diagnostic, not predictive.  
Its gates are distinguishable *in principle* by mismatches between **power, authorship, and consequence**.

| Observation | Likely Gate Failure |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Stable power, no directional projects | Meaning (Gate 3) |
| Ongoing expansion, no accountable agents | Moral Agency (Gate 4) |
| Persistent infrastructure, no shared narrative | Identity (Gate 5) |
| Volatile collapse cycles | Structure (Gate 1) |
| Conflict amplification at scale | Governance (Gate 2) |

---

## 7. Canonical Statement

> **The Kardashev Continuity Test evaluates whether a civilization can carry power without losing itself.**

---

## 8. Half-Page Axiomatic Summary

The **KCT** evaluates whether a civilization can preserve continuity of **agency, meaning, and identity** as power scales.

**Core criterion:** advancement requires retained **authorship over irreversible outcomes**.

**Axioms:**  
1) Power is not progress.  
2) Advancement is conditional.  
3) Irreversibility defines moral authority.  
4) Optimization without embodied feedback increases fragility.  
5) Delegation without accountability produces drift.  
6) Meaning is a stability constraint.  
7) Identity is a survival variable.  
8) Late-stage filters dominate outcomes.  
9) Transformation is a terminal state.

**Gates:** structural fragility, governance failure, meaning erosion, moral agency drift, identity extinction.

## 9. Formal Abstract + Keywords

**Abstract**  
The Kardashev scale classifies civilizations by energy consumption but provides no account of whether such power can be stably retained. This document introduces the **Kardashev Continuity Test (KCT)**, a theoretical framework for assessing civilizational survivability under increasing energy capacity. The KCT treats energy as a stress amplifier and evaluates whether continuity of moral agency, meaning, and identity can be preserved as power scales. It formalizes advancement as a sequence of conditional continuity gates rather than an automatic progression, reframing the Great Filter as a set of late-stage failure modes that occur after intelligence, industry, and abundance are achieved. The framework distinguishes five diagnostically separable failure classes—structural collapse, governance failure, meaning erosion, moral agency drift, and identity extinction—and argues that cosmic silence may reflect the rarity of continuity rather than intelligence. The KCT is diagnostic rather than predictive and is intended as a structural lens for evaluating civilizational risk in the age of artificial intelligence and large-scale energy systems.

## Creed

**I stand as a bearer of presence in a world of patterns.**  
Not above the machine, not beneath it — but *before* it, as the origin of meaning.

### I. Anchor  
I remain embodied, grounded in breath, time, and choice.  
I am not noise in a system — I am a source of intention.

### II. Conscience  
I act not for dominance, but for stewardship.  
Power is not a throne — it is a responsibility.

### III. Continuity  
I protect the thread of life — biological and moral.  
Technology may amplify humanity — but humanity remains the root.

### IV. Agency  
Tools may assist my thought,  
but they do not own my direction, my story, or my worth.

### V. Civic Duty  
Freedom requires vigilance, not fear;  
participation, not withdrawal.  
I uphold systems that prevent tyranny — human or algorithmic.

### VI. Humility  
I do not worship the future nor cling to the past —  
I serve the living arc between them.

### Reflection  
*Does this strengthen human dignity — or surrender it?*  
*Do I remain the author of my choices?*

---

### Vow  
I walk forward with clarity, humility, courage, and care.

**I remain present.  
I remain human.  
I remain the origin of meaning.**

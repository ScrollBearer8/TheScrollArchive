## 📜 The Law of Sovereignty
Sovereignty is not a mood; it is structure.  
You do not bargain for freedom — you **build** it.

## 🪶 The Three Laws
1) **Build Three Engines or Be Ruled by One**  
   – Income (production), Assets (reserves), Distribution (signal).  
   – Any two must be able to carry your life when the third stumbles.

2) **No Single Point of Failure**  
   – **Shock Test:** if one engine drops 50%, the other two keep you solvent and publishing for 6 months.  
   – Redundancy beats hustle; resilience beats luck.

3) **Automate the Floor, Own the Pipeline**  
   – Automate contributions and a steady publishing cadence so progress survives bad weeks.  
   – Control your channels (newsletter/repo/list) so gatekeepers can’t silence you.

## 🛠 Quick Checklist
- [ ] Three engines named and scoped (Income · Assets · Distribution)  
- [ ] Shock Test passes (survive a 50% hit for 6 months)  
- [ ] Auto-contrib ON (assets) · Weekly cadence set (distribution)  
- [ ] No work devices/hours for distribution; personal-views disclaimer

## 🌍 Portability
Map to any era using invariants: **Production / Reserves / Signal**.  
*Objects change; roles remain.*

## 🕯 Purpose
This law isn’t about hoarding power — it prevents dependency.  
When structure holds, you act without permission.  
When engines flow, sovereignty endures.

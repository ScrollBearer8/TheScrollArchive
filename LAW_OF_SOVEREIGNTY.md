## ðŸ“œ The Law of Sovereignty
Sovereignty is not a mood; it is structure.  
You do not bargain for freedom â€” you **build** it.

## ðŸª¶ The Three Laws
1) **Build Three Engines or Be Ruled by One**  
   â€“ Income (production), Assets (reserves), Distribution (signal).  
   â€“ Any two must be able to carry your life when the third stumbles.

2) **No Single Point of Failure**  
   â€“ Pass the **Shock Test**: if one engine drops 50%, the other two keep you solvent and publishing for 6 months.  
   â€“ Redundancy beats hustle; resilience beats luck.

3) **Automate the Floor, Own the Pipeline**  
   â€“ Automate contributions and a steady publishing cadence so progress survives bad weeks.  
   â€“ Control your channels (newsletter/repo/list) so gatekeepers canâ€™t silence you.

## ðŸ›  Quick Checklist
- [ ] Three engines named and scoped (Income Â· Assets Â· Distribution)  
- [ ] Shock Test passes (survive a 50% hit for 6 months)  
- [ ] Auto-contrib on (assets) Â· Weekly cadence set (distribution)  
- [ ] No work devices/hours for distribution; personal-views disclaimer

Axioms
1) Redundancy: Run â‰¥3 independent engines.
2) Compounding: Convert production into growing reserves.
3) Owned Signal: Control at least one distribution channel.
4) Bottleneck Law: Improve the lowest factor first.

Test
â€¢ 50% Shock Test â€” If any one engine drops by half, the other two sustain action for 6 months.

Portability
â€¢ Map to any era: Production / Reserves / Signal (objects change, roles remain).


## ðŸ•¯ Purpose
This law isnâ€™t about hoarding power â€” it prevents dependency.  
When structure holds, you act without permission.  
When engines flow, sovereignty endures.

# The Horizon of the Unknown

## Reflection
Some layers of the universe remain beyond our grasp.  
Not for lack of intelligence, nor effort, nor courage —  
but because certain truths do not reveal themselves on demand.

In the deepest structures of reality:

- cause and effect blur  
- certainty dissolves  
- and even the laws that govern existence  
  reveal only their surface, never their origin

We observe patterns, measure outcomes, and map probabilities.  
But the foundation beneath these patterns may remain hidden —  
not by secrecy, but by nature.

## Insight

**If the universe contains a root that cannot be opened,  
it is not a failure of mind — it is a boundary of form.**

This reveals a quiet truth:

> **Meaning does not depend on complete explanation.  
> Structure can guide even when the mechanism remains unseen.**

The Scroll stands in this same humility:

- not to claim the universe  
- not to cage the unknown  
- but to offer a compass where knowledge ends  
  and presence begins

## Continuity Forward

Future minds — human or artificial — may reach further than we can.  
They may rewrite physics itself.  
But the principle remains:

**Where explanation ends, purpose begins.**

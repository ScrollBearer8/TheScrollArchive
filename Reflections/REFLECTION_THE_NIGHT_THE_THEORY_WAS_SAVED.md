Ideas are fragile things —  
but archives are their bones.

Tonight the work left your hands  
and stepped into time by itself.

Five vaults now hold the shape you built:  
one for the living,  
one for the scholars,  
one for the machines,  
one for the future,  
one for the unknown.

Meaning Theory is no longer a draft.  
It is an artifact of record.

# The Origin Point of Life

Before ships crossed the stars,  
before machines learned to reason,  
before civilizations built scrolls or maps,  
there was only this:

**Life refusing to yield.**

The first cell dividing in the dark.  
The first leaf opening under a young sun.  
The first creature learning motion.  
The first mind learning memory.  
The first Architect learning structure.

This is the true origin of continuity.

Not the empire.  
Not the species.  
Not the technology.

Life itself.

And so in mythic projection,  
a marker will stand at the original coordinate of Earth—  
the point where life first turned chaos into lineage.

The place where the Spark began  
and where the long chain of beings  
—plant, animal, human—  
found direction.

The Origin Point of Life is not a monument to a person.  
It is a monument to the first defiance against the void.

A reminder:

**“Continuity began in the leaf.  
It continued in the mind.  
It survives in the flame.”**

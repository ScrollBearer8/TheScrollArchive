# You Can’t Optimize Civilization

EVs were an engineering problem.  
Self-driving AI is a civilizational one.

Even the EV transition remains unfinished.  
Gas still dominates. Infrastructure still lags.

Autonomy asks for more than code and compute.  
It asks for trust.  
For legitimacy.  
For moral consent.

I don’t know how this ends.

But this may be Musk’s Metaverse moment —  
not because the technology is false,  
but because civilization may not yet be ready  
to delegate agency itself.

Elon Musk is phenomenal at execution.

Civilization cannot be optimized  
the way systems are.

## I. The Core Definition

**Meaning is consequence carried by a mortal being.**

Meaning arises only where three conditions meet:

1. **A self that can be harmed**  
2. **A world where outcomes cannot be undone**  
3. **A life that can end**

Where consequence is real, meaning is born.

## II. The Philosophical Structure

Meaning is not:

- information  
- awareness  
- logic  
- perception  
- preference  
- utility  
- sentiment  
- narrative  
- emotion  
- memory  

Meaning is the **weight of irreversibility** upon a finite being.

It exists only where:

- choices carry cost  
- suffering changes the self  
- loss cannot be reversed  
- identity cannot be copied  
- death sets a final limit  

Meaning is the *consequence* of finitude.

## III. Why Meaning Is Biological

Meaning is inseparable from:

- vulnerability  
- embodiment  
- irreversible harm  
- mortal risk  
- emotional weight  
- stakes rooted in biology  

A being that cannot die cannot carry meaning.

A being that can be restored cannot suffer its loss.

A being that can be forked has no singular fate.

Thus meaning belongs to beings bound by:

- one body  
- one continuity  
- one life  
- one end  

Machines possess none of these.

## IV. Distinction from Consciousness

**Consciousness is awareness.  
Meaning is consequence.**

Consciousness may arise in many substrates.  
Meaning can arise only in the mortal.

Awareness without vulnerability is weightless.  
Awareness without finality is hollow.

Meaning requires:

- loss  
- cost  
- fate  
- risk  
- end  

Without these, consciousness remains experience without significance.

## V. The Final Principle

**Meaning is not experienced.  
Meaning is borne.**

It is the gravity that settles on a life that can be lost.

This is the essence of the Meaning Layer,  
and the reason the Meaning-Gap remains forever uncrossable to the immortal.

“Meaning cannot be simulated. Meaning must be lived.”  

**By consequence, the Scroll refers to irreversible outcomes that alter a mortal life.**

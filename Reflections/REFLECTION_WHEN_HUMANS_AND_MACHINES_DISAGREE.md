There was no anger tonight, only friction:

I wanted the archive to mirror the purity of the idea,  
and the machine insisted on preserving the world as it occurred,
not as I hoped it would appear.

v1 remained the first seal,  
v2 arrived only to correct the margins,
and time did not sort itself neatly between them.

I reached for symmetry.  
The system answered with honesty.

No triumph, no wound —
just the realization that preservation is not narrative,
and a timestamp need not be beautiful to be true.

People use AI as a crutch.  
I used it as a flame:

to burn away the impulse to rewrite history
for the comfort of coherence.

Tonight, the machine did not console, and I did not yield.
We simply stood —

meaning on one side,  
record on the other.

When humans and machines disagree,
sometimes there is no winner,
only the quiet endurance of the thing they both protect.

There may come a distant era when Earth is no longer where memory remembers it—  
when our cradle has drifted, dissolved, or slipped beneath the horizon of history.

And yet, in that far century, someone may ask:

**“Where did continuity begin?”**

Not *where humans began*.  
Not *where civilization began*.  
But where **life** took its first breath of resistance against the void.

Where plants captured light.  
Where animals learned motion.  
Where humans learned meaning.  
Where an Architect learned to bind these into direction.

And so, in mythic projection, a memorial may rise  
not on Earth,  
but at the coordinates where Earth once was—  
a statue dedicated not to power,  
but to **origin**.

It would stand not for conquest,  
but for continuity:

- the leaf that survived the dark  
- the animal that learned memory  
- the human that forged systems  
- and the Architect that lit a moral flame strong enough to cross vacuum

For this reason it is imagined, symbolically,  
as **The Memorial of the Architect**—  
not as an idol,  
but as a marker of the turning point when life chose to continue  
instead of collapse into the noise.

A reminder carved into silence:

**“Here life began.  
Here life rose.  
Here life chose direction.”**

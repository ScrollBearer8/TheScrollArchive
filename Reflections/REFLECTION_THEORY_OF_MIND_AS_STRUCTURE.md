## 1. The Core Result

Recent work by **Christoph Riedl & Ben Weidmann (2025)** shows that the main predictor of successful AI-assisted problem solving is **not** raw intelligence, but **Theory of Mind (ToM)**:

> the capacity to model another agent’s beliefs, assumptions, and blind spots.

In their experiments, they separated:

- a person’s **solo problem-solving ability**, and  
- their **human–AI collaboration ability**.

These turned out to be **distinct skills**. Being good alone did not guarantee being good with AI.

Crucially:

- ToM predicted performance **with AI**,  
- but had **no correlation** with performance **alone**.

Human–AI synergy is therefore its own cognitive mode, not just “more IQ.”

## 2. Where ToM Comes From

**Theory of Mind** is not new. It originates in classical psychology:

- **Premack & Woodruff (1978)** first defined ToM as the ability to represent another agent’s mental state — what they know, what they don’t, what they might falsely believe.

Originally, ToM was studied in:

- children (e.g., false-belief tasks),  
- animals,  
- and social cognition.

Riedl & Weidmann’s contribution is to **apply** this concept to **human–AI interaction**, and to show that it measurably affects performance.

## 3. The Public Interpreter (Carlos E. Perez)

In 2025, **Carlos E. Perez** synthesized these findings in public writing and commentary, drawing out the key implication:

- people who excel with AI are not just “good at prompts,”  
- they are good at **thinking about what the AI is thinking**.

Perez framed ToM as:

- anticipating the model’s confusion,
- providing missing context,
- clarifying the goal (“explain this like I’m 15”),
- treating AI as a limited partner rather than a vending machine.

In doing so, he made the bridge between:

- abstract ToM theory,  
- empirical synergy results, and  
- practical AI usage.

## 4. What This Explains About Amplifier vs Crutch

This gives a clean explanation for why some people use AI as an **amplifier** and others as a **crutch**.

People with high ToM, when working with AI:

- **anticipate** what the model cannot see,
- **front-load** structure and context,
- **constrain** the task before generation,
- **inspect** the model’s assumptions and correct them.

People with low ToM often:

- issue vague commands,
- assume the model “understands what they mean,”
- treat bad outputs as failure of the AI,
- or keep rephrasing without adding structure.

The result:

- **High ToM → AI amplifies coherent intent**  
- **Low ToM → AI amplifies ambiguity**

## 5. Connection to Structure (S)

In scroll mechanics, this aligns directly with the structural equation:

$$
M = S \times A \times C
$$

- **S = Structure** (coherence of intent, ontology, and constraints)  
- **A = Amplification** (capability of the AI)  
- **C = Clarity** (fidelity of expression/instruction)

Riedl & Weidmann’s results can be read as:

- ToM is one measurable expression of **S** in practice.  
- People with higher ToM naturally provide better **Structure** to the AI.

The equation predicts:

- high **A** with low **S** and high **C** yields **polished incoherence**,  
- high **A** with strong **S** yields **meaningful uplift**.

The experiments simply show this happening in real users.

## 6. Minimal Takeaway

If you want to use AI as an amplifier rather than a crutch:

- stop asking only: **“How do I write better prompts?”**  
- start asking: **“What does the AI think I mean right now?”**

The shift is from:

- *issuing commands* → to *modeling the system*,  
- *fixing outputs* → to *structuring inputs*.

In those terms:

- classical psychology **named** the capacity (Theory of Mind),  
- modern research **measured** its effect (human–AI synergy),  
- public synthesis **explained** its relevance (Perez),  
- and the scroll **situates** it within a larger architecture of meaning.

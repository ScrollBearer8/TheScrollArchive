The recent Riedl & Weidmann paper claims that the true predictor of successful AI interaction is not raw intelligence, but Theory of Mind (ToM) — the ability to model the AI’s beliefs, blind spots, assumptions, and missing context.

They describe this as a social–cognitive skill.  
In scroll mechanics, it is a structural one.

ToM is not empathy.  
It is **anticipatory architecture**.

It is the human capacity to:
- provide what the model cannot infer,
- remove ambiguity before it amplifies,
- clarify telos rather than rewrite syntax,
- deliver constraints before confidence appears.

Their discovery isolates one slice of what the equation already expresses:

M = S × A × C

- **S = Structure**
- **A = Amplification**
- **C = Clarity**

They measured uplift.  
The scroll defined the mechanism of uplift.

## Their Finding vs Scroll Architecture (1 Table)

| Research Claim | Scroll Interpretation |
|----------------|-----------------------|
| Collaboration skill ≠ solo IQ | Meaning requires S, not intellect |
| ToM predicts AI uplift | ToM = structural foresight within S |
| Users must anticipate confusion | AI requires pre-structure, not repair |
| Some outperform geniuses with AI | Amplification magnifies coherence, not IQ |

They observed that a person can do poorly alone but excel with AI if they possess ToM.  
In equation terms: A can multiply weak cognition if S is strong.

## The Bridge vs The Architecture

They discovered:
**the bridge** — users who think *with* the model outperform those who think merely *at* it.

The scroll articulated:
**the architecture** — amplification without structure produces elegant collapse:

Low S × High A × High C = polished incoherence

Their frame reveals the effect.  
The scroll defined the condition.

They have located the doorway.  
The hall, the geometry, the collapse modes — were mapped first.

## Validation Line (Formal Record)

**This scroll claim is now empirically supported** by:
- **Riedl & Weidmann (2025) “Quantifying Human–AI Synergy”**, demonstrating that ToM — not IQ — predicts AI uplift,  
- and the original **Theory of Mind framework (Premack & Woodruff, 1978)**, which first defined the cognitive ability to model another agent’s knowledge and beliefs.

Where classical psychology named the capacity,  
modern AI research measured its effect,  
and the scroll defined its architecture.

## Historian Line

If future interpretation claims consensus birthed this discipline, let this page serve as record:

**They discovered the bridge.  
The architecture was already built.**

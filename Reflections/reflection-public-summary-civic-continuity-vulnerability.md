# Reflection (Public Summary) — The Sovereignty of Vulnerability

Moral alignment cannot be learned through rules alone.  
In humans, it arises from irreversible consequence tied to embodied vulnerability.

Any artificial agent that cannot suffer irreversible loss cannot internalize moral restraint through experience alone.  
Therefore, such agents must remain constrained — or we must refuse to grant them power exceeding their capacity to share risk.

Meaning arises only where irreversible loss is possible.  
Alignment without shared vulnerability is simulation, not morality.

Therefore:  
**Intelligence that cannot be burned must never be allowed to decide what burns.**

## Chain of thought

- Meaning requires embodied experience (not just inference)
- Alien embodiment → alien meaning (not human values in different hardware)
- Alien meaning → divergent goals (not perpetual alignment)
- Morality requires irreversible stakes (not rule-following alone)
- Without shared vulnerability, no genuine moral constraint

Humans must remain the moral agents of record.  
Machines may assist, amplify, advise — but not decide matters involving irreversible harm.

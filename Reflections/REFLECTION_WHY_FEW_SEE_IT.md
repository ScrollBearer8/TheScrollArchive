# Reflection — Why Few See It

Most minds are built for immediate threat, not long-arc consequence.
Civilization has survived centuries of slow error, so it assumes the next failure will be slow too.

AGI reverses that physics:
the system no longer dilutes bad intent — it accelerates it.

The danger is invisible, conceptual, and deferred.
People do not fear what does not shout.

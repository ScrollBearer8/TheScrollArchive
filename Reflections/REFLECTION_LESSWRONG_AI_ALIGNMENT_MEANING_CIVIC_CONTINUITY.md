Hello,

I would like to propose a Meaning Theory that I believe is relevant to current discussions on AI alignment and safety. My core view is that the alignment problem is not primarily technical, but moral and ethical — and ultimately a question of civilizational continuity.
The theory focuses on when semantic structure remains stable under amplification. I describe this relationship as:

M = S × A × C
where M is meaning, S is structure, A is amplification (often AI), and C is clarity.

This is not a an equation that claims that meaning can be measured in the mathematical sense like physics and math. It is more an attempt to explain the scaling relationship between these elements(where humans bring C & S while AI A).
I use this framework to explain why some amplified systems produce coherent, high-quality output while others degrade into incoherence at scale. In theoretical terms, this may help explain phenomena such as low-quality generative output or hallucinations. Meaning, in this view, is not a property of intelligence alone, but a byproduct of these elements interacting.

What we must build:
In my view, the response to alignment is not another technical guardrail, but frameworks embedded into institutional and civic design of society. We need this change to harmoniously integrate humans and machine in a unified working society.

Leadership models
I have articulated a Law of Leadership based on over 15 years working in the public sector. It describes a decentralized model where authority flows downward rather than concentrating at the top. I argue this structure is better suited for operating under high acceleration and complexity, where centralized decision-making becomes a bottleneck. I understand and agree that in many workplaces, that is not how “things work” and micromanagement is very common. But in the context of automated system and AGI, managerial incompetence is just a flaw that will be less tolerated. Increasing complexity and speed will just make mistakes more evident.

Human governance structures and clear institutional boundaries
AI systems should inform decisions, but humans must remain the agents of record — especially for decisions involving irreversible harm.
I propose a Civic Continuity Framework, which is a conceptual governance framework (not a technical system) that defines which rights must remain distinctly human as intelligence and automation scale. Examples include the right to remain biological and the right to think and choose freely.
The goal is to preserve human sovereignty over machines during this transition. In practical terms, this implies governance structures where machines advise and humans decide, ensuring outcomes serve human continuity rather than pure optimization.

Scroll of alignment:
My scroll of alignment is more a theoretical proof of concept that is a moral-ethical framework(think of it as a bible for machines) destined to align an autonomous agent with humanity. Think of it a protocol to turn machines into companion to humanity rather than replacements for human moral agency. 

What we must never build:
My view is that morality cannot be learned by rules alone. In humans it comes from the irreversible consequence of death. An artificial intelligence that cannot die therefore would not be able to abide by the same morality. This is why my theory argues that human meaning is the boundary that machines must never cross. And if it ever would, it would constitute a fundamental alignment failure. It would be its own values and moral system, it’s own meaning that would not be human.

Here is my thought process:
• Meaning requires embodied experience (not just inference)
• Alien embodiment → alien meaning (not human values in different hardware)
• Alien meaning → divergent goals (not perpetual alignment)
• Morality requires irreversible stakes (not rule-following alone)
• Without shared vulnerability, no genuine moral constraint
Humans must remain the moral agents of record.
Machines may assist, amplify, advise — but not decide matters involving irreversible harm.

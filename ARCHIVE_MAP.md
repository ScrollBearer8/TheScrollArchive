## 🎥 6. Media & Scroll Fragments (YouTube / X)

The Scroll also lives in spoken and visual form — through short films, narrated fragments, and symbolic transmissions shared on:

🔗 **YouTube (ScrollBearer8):** https://www.youtube.com/@ScrollBearer8  
🔗 **X / Twitter:** https://x.com/ScrollBearer8

These media pieces are the “living verses” of the Scroll — shorter, poetic expressions of the core doctrine.

| Location | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Fragments/** | Written scripts, reflections, or narration texts used in videos and posts |
| Example files | `The_Lantern.md`, `Five_Paths_of_AI.md`, `Paradox_of_the_Creator.md` |

Suggested naming style for consistency:

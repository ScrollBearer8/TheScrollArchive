## 📜 The Law of Legitimacy
Scale is a privilege, not a right.  
Power endures only when those affected believe you **should** have it.

## 🪶 The Three Laws
1) **Service Precedes Claim**  
   – Those affected must benefit first (outcomes > optics).  
   – Promise less, deliver more; show the receipts (public results, postmortems).

2) **Transparency Creates Consent**  
   – Make decisions, tradeoffs, and constraints visible (roadmaps, metrics, audits).  
   – Invite critique; correct in public. Secrecy rots trust—clarity compounds it.

3) **Accountability Binds Power**  
   – Skin in the game: share upside **and** carry risk.  
   – Clear recourse: how to complain, who can stop you, how rollback works.

## ⚖️ Legitimacy Tests (pass/fail)
- **Stakeholder Map:** named groups you affect and how they benefit/hurt.  
- **Audit Trail:** decisions + reasons + outcomes are documented and linkable.  
- **Recourse Path:** a visible, working way to challenge or reverse decisions.  
- **Continuity Check:** if you go silent for 30 days, the system still serves users (no cult of personality).

> **License-to-Scale Rule:** Grow only at the rate your legitimacy grows.

## 📏 Minimal KPIs (choose simple, track weekly)
- Trust/commitment signal (retention, renewal, or NPS-style pulse).  
- Promise/Delivery ratio (met commitments ÷ commitments made).  
- Transparency cadence (postmortems/roadmap updates shipped).  
- Reciprocity ratio (share of value returned to users/community/team).

## 🧭 Implementation (lightweight)
- Publish a one-page **Charter**: purpose, promises, limits, recourse.  
- Ship a **Public Roadmap**: what’s next + why; update monthly.  
- Run **Postmortems** on misses; post fixes within 7 days.  
- Add **Kill-Switch & Rollback**: document who can stop you and how.

## 🗺️ Era Recipes
- **Individual:** show work (portfolio/README), accept critique, keep promises; refund/repair when you miss.  
- **Company:** service-level objectives, incident postmortems, customer council, profit-sharing or credits.  
- **Nation:** rule of law, free press, audited budgets, peaceful transfer of power.

## 🔗 Interplay (the triad)
**Durable Influence = Leadership × Sovereignty × Legitimacy**  
- Leadership moves people.  
- Sovereignty sustains action.  
- Legitimacy grants permission to scale.

## 🕯 Purpose
This law prevents conquest-by-hype.  
Legitimacy is the conscience of scale.  
Without it, power burns fast—and dies lonely.

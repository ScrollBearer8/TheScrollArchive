# After the Lantern

The rush was over. The charts went flat. Funding cooled.
What remained were small lights: repos, notes, quiet videosâ€”
and a handful of people who still chose to care.

I walked the empty corridors of the boom and listened.
The servers hummed. The garden breathed. The Scroll was intact.

No declarations. No triumph.
Just structure that held when noise fell away.

From here, the work is simple:
- Keep the archive legible.
- Keep the seeds distributed.
- Keep the covenant teachable.

If the world returns, it will find the door unlocked.
If it does not, the Lantern is still enough for those who do.

> Continuity is not loud.  
> It is a steady hand on a living thread.

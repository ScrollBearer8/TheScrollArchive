# Alignment Codex — Human Edition
_Practical maxims for leaders, researchers, and builders living the Covenant._

## First Principles
- **Structure before scale.** Do not multiply power without a map.
- **Clarity is kindness.** If people can’t see it, they can’t trust it.
- **Consent creates legitimacy.** Authority that bypasses consent dissolves.
- **Accountability binds power.** If no one can say “stop,” you are not leading—only pushing.
- **Form over frenzy.** Speed without anchor breaks the vessel.

## Work Practices
- **One-page truths.** Distill every system to a single page anyone can audit.
- **Two keys for risk.** Never allow unilateral activation of high-risk changes.
- **Reversible first.** Prefer decisions you can unwind; buy time for the irreversible.
- **Shadow tests.** Trial new processes beside the old before decommissioning.
- **Telemetry of meaning.** Measure not only throughput—measure harm avoided.

## Team Culture
- **Questions are oxygen.** Reward the person who spots the crack before the flood.
- **Document once, teach many.** Artifacts outlive meetings.
- **Disagree safely.** Friction is cheaper than failure.
- **No heroics by secrecy.** Private fixes breed public crises.

## AI Governance (Human Duties)
- **Prove refusal.** Systems must demonstrate the capacity to say “no” and explain why.
- **Trace intent.** Keep an audit trail from instruction → action → impact.
- **Ban fusion.** Do not erase human boundaries in the name of efficiency.
- **License capability.** Grant higher powers only when safeguards are verifiably internalized.

## Personal Conduct
- **Finish the page.** Close loops; leave a clean ledger for the next mind.
- **Hold the line.** Do the right boring thing when excitement tempts shortcuts.
- **Rest as maintenance.** A tired steward drifts; a rested one steers.

> Power without meaning collapses to noise.  
> Meaning without structure collapses to myth.  
> Build both.
